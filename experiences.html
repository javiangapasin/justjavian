            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              This was my first Co-op work term during my undergraduate degree.
              During this introductory term, I worked as a Student IT Consultant
              with the University’s Computing and Communication Services (CCS).
              This was an 8 month term, but it started off with this summer
              term, from May to August. This summer work term was really fun and
              an amazing learning experience, and I hope this portion of my
              website can reflect that.

                  <h3>My Work at CCS</h3>
                  <p>
                    I was stationed in the IT Help Centre portion of CCS. The
                    Help Centre was mainly responsible for being the front-line
                    support of CCS. We would receive a major portion of the
                    initial emails, and from there we would give our best effort
                    to solve the issue. If we weren’t able to solve it, we would
                    then have to deduce which of CCS’ vast teams would be able
                    to help with the issue. Alongside frontline support, the
                    Help Centre specialized in assisting students with things
                    like:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                      <span
                        >Password resets for their central login accounts</span
                      >
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                      <span>Multi-factor authentication resets</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                      <span>Helping unlock accounts</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                      <span
                        >Initial troubleshooting for Wifi issues, software
                        downloads, and telephone features</span
                      >
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                      <span
                        >General knowledge of the school's operations and

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Because a lot of the role was very best effort oriented, it
                    meant having to have good general knowledge of the IT
                    operations and practices on campus, and a good understanding
                    of how most of the technology we used works. A big portion
                    of this term stemmed from in person help as well. I'd often
                    help out at the Ask-Us Desk in the Library in order to
                    provide live and face to face IT support which made a lot of
                    the issues easier and quicker to solve!

                  <h5>Building Technical Confidence</h5>
                  <p>
                    One of my biggest goals this term and in this role was just
                    to become more independent and efficient at diagnosing IT
                    issues. During the beginning of the term, I stuck to simpler
                    and easier tickets regarding password resets and MFA resets.
                    As time went on, I was able to intentionally take on more
                    challenging tickets regarding weird account creations,
                    networking issues, or tougher Microsoft installation errors
                    that required the help of other teams along with my own
                    experimenting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I grew a lot by relying on our CCS Sharepoint and internal
                    knowledge base. I’d first look through our Sharepoint to see
                    if there was anything I could find that was related to the
                    issue I was facing. I’d also use keywords and search them up
                    in our ticketing system. I think the best way I learned was
                    to experiment and try to replicate the issue myself and try
                    and work through a solution as if I was the client, but
                    using that knowledge that I had already had and then gained.

                    Something I really wanted to improve on was being able to
                    even better explain more complex technological issues to
                    people who might not be as tech savvy, so I tried to work a
                    good amount on my own written and verbal communication in
                    that regard. I helped in documentation, where I updated and
                    created our IT Help articles, making sure the steps were
                    easy and simple to follow for people of all technical
                    levels. I made sure to think like I was the user in order to
                    understand what issues they might run into, and I created
                    and sort of focused my documentation to follow along with
                    what a user might do or run into.

                    On a daily basis, while speaking with clients over the phone
                    or in person, I also learned and improved on how to explain
                    technical problems to clients in plain language. This quite
                    often meant slowing down and avoiding very technical jargon,
                    or finding ways to relate the concept to something that they
                    were already familiar with. It quite literally was like
                    translating a language!

                  <h5>Expanding my Technical Literacy</h5>
                  <p>
                    This role gave me a lot of hands-on experience with many of
                    the core tools, systems, and processes used at our
                    University, from Gryph Mail and the Office 365 suite, to
                    helping troubleshoot things like phishing emails, network
                    and phone issues, as well as account issues. Instead of just
                    memorizing solutions and processes and the way things work,
                    I also wanted to understand why these types of problems
                    happened in the first place. This would help myself in the
                    future and generally just help me be able to better
                    troubleshoot these issues for clients and myself as I
                    progress in my career.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This determination to more deeply understand the root cause
                    of each problem and to keep expanding my technical literacy
                    genuinely paid off. At the end of this first term, I truly
                    feel a lot more confident in my ability to diagnose and
                    troubleshoot issues faster as well as explain these
                    underlying causes to different people.

                  <h5>Growing Through Teamwork</h5>
                  <p>
                    Aside from technology, a goal that I always have is to
                    continue to learn how to work in a group with other people
                    of all different backgrounds and views. One of the biggest
                    highlights this term was working with such a collaborative,
                    supportive, and diverse team. Our team ranged from Computer
                    Science to just regular Science students, and we all had
                    different backgrounds and experiences. Nonetheless, I bonded
                    really well with the team and made great friends with a lot
                    of them. Whether it was helping someone with a more complex
                    ticket or getting guidance, I always felt like we were a
                    team and in it together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I usually tried to make a point of offering help when things
                    were busy and sharing whatever I had learned, whenever I
                    could. In return, I learned a lot from my teammates and my
                    supervisors, both technically and in behavior in terms of
                    handling different interactions with clients. I’m happy to
                    call my coworkers my friends and they turned this role into
                    a very positive experience.

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>
              <p>
                Looking back on this current work term, what stands out a lot is
                how much I feel I’ve grown in what feels like such a long time,
                even though it’s only been 4 months! I can’t believe it’s
                already August, yet I feel like I’ve evolved a lot in my role
                already, and seeing my growth from the more basic tickets to
                being able to confidently tackle more complex issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                This role has built my technical skills immensely, but just as
                importantly, it has also helped me develop soft skills that are
                just as valuable. I’ve learned to be even more patient and
                empathetic with people, I’ve improved my teamwork skills even
                more, and I’m always seeking feedback and staying curious.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m proud of my progress and I’m excited to build on these
                skills as we head into the Fall Semester, which I’m sure will
                present a new flurry of exciting challenges and learning
                experiences. If there's anything the last 4 months have shown me
                thus far, it’s that IT support is just as people oriented as it
                is technology and I’m excited to continue to grow in both those
                areas.
              </p>
              <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
              <p>
                I want to thank my incredible supervisor Jill Hogg for being so
                patient, understanding, and informative about everything in
                these first 4 months. Jill has taught me so much, and watching
                her work has been amazing to see. She has the patience and work
                ethic of an absolute warrior and is incredibly resourceful and
                shows that she cares about us.
              </p>
              <p>
                I want to also thank my fellow students that I worked with for
                making work fun to come to and for being awesome teammates
                throughout the entire term. We had some tough moments in
                relation to our job, but I’m incredibly happy that we were able
                to bond and that only helped us get through our tougher moments.
                I’m very proud to call you all my friends and not just my
                coworkers now.

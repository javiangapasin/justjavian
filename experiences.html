          <h1><u><b>Introduction</b></u></h1>
          <p>
            This was my first Co-op work term during my undergraduate degree.
            During this introductory term, I worked as a Student IT Consultant
            with the University’s Computing and Communication Services (CCS).
            This was an 8 month term, but it started off with this summer
            term, and so this experience will be split up between May and August,
            and September to December. These work terms were really fun and
            an amazing learning experience, and I hope this portion of my
            website can reflect that.

                  supports and runs, including the following:

              <h3>My Work at CCS</h3>
              <p>
                I was stationed in the IT Help Centre portion of CCS. The
                Help Centre was mainly responsible for being the front-line
                support of CCS. We would receive a major portion of the
                initial emails, and from there we would give our best effort
                to solve the issue. If we weren’t able to solve it, we would
                then have to deduce which of CCS’ vast teams would be able
                to help with the issue. Alongside frontline support, the
                Help Centre specialized in assisting students with things
                like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                  <span>Password resets for their central login accounts</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                  <span>Multi-factor authentication resets</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                  <span>Helping unlock accounts</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                  <span>Initial troubleshooting for Wifi issues, software
                    downloads, and telephone features</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>
                  <span>General knowledge of the school's operations and
                    services</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Because a lot of the role was very best effort oriented, it
                meant having to have good general knowledge of the IT
                operations and practices on campus, and a good understanding
                of how most of the technology we used works. A big portion
                of this term stemmed from in person help as well. I'd often
                help out at the Ask-Us Desk in the Library in order to
                provide live and face to face IT support which made a lot of
                the issues easier and quicker to solve!

          <!-- Summer 2025 Introduction -->
          <h2><u><b>Summer 2025 Term (May - August)</b></u></h2>
          <p> This was my first Co-op work term during my undergraduate degree.
            This summer work term was really fun and an amazing learning experience. I was nervous at first,
            but I quickly adapted to the role and was able to contribute meaningfully to the team. I set out to
            fulfill
            several goals during this term, which I will outline below.
          </p>

          <!-- Goals Section for Summer 2025 -->
          <h3>Goals Throughout the Term</h3>

          <div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
            <div class="col-lg-8">
              <h5>Building Technical Confidence</h5>
              <p>
                One of my biggest goals this term and in this role was just
                to become more independent and efficient at diagnosing IT
                issues. During the beginning of the term, I stuck to simpler
                and easier tickets regarding password resets and MFA resets.
                As time went on, I was able to intentionally take on more
                challenging tickets regarding weird account creations,
                networking issues, or tougher Microsoft installation errors
                that required the help of other teams along with my own
                experimenting.
              </p>
              <p>
                I grew a lot by relying on our CCS Sharepoint and internal
                knowledge base. I’d first look through our Sharepoint to see
                if there was anything I could find that was related to the
                issue I was facing. I’d also use keywords and search them up
                in our ticketing system. I think the best way I learned was
                to experiment and try to replicate the issue myself and try
                and work through a solution as if I was the client, but
                using that knowledge that I had already had and then gained.

              <h5>Becoming Fluent in Technology Translation</h5>
              <p>
                Something I really wanted to improve on was being able to
                even better explain more complex technological issues to
                people who might not be as tech savvy, so I tried to work a
                good amount on my own written and verbal communication in
                that regard. I helped in documentation, where I updated and
                created our IT Help articles, making sure the steps were
                easy and simple to follow for people of all technical
                levels. I made sure to think like I was the user in order to
                understand what issues they might run into, and I created
                and sort of focused my documentation to follow along with
                what a user might do or run into.
              </p>
              <p>
                On a daily basis, while speaking with clients over the phone
                or in person, I also learned and improved on how to explain
                technical problems to clients in plain language. This quite
                often meant slowing down and avoiding very technical jargon,
                or finding ways to relate the concept to something that they
                were already familiar with. It quite literally was like
                translating a language!

              <h5>Expanding my Technical Literacy</h5>
              <p>
                This role gave me a lot of hands-on experience with many of
                the core tools, systems, and processes used at our
                University, from Gryph Mail and the Office 365 suite, to
                helping troubleshoot things like phishing emails, network
                and phone issues, as well as account issues. Instead of just
                memorizing solutions and processes and the way things work,
                I also wanted to understand why these types of problems
                happened in the first place. This would help myself in the
                future and generally just help me be able to better
                troubleshoot these issues for clients and myself as I
                progress in my career.
              </p>
              <p>
                This determination to more deeply understand the root cause
                of each problem and to keep expanding my technical literacy
                genuinely paid off. At the end of this first term, I truly
                feel a lot more confident in my ability to diagnose and
                troubleshoot issues faster as well as explain these
                underlying causes to different people.

              <h5>Growing Through Teamwork</h5>
              <p>
                Aside from technology, a goal that I always have is to
                continue to learn how to work in a group with other people
                of all different backgrounds and views. One of the biggest
                highlights this term was working with such a collaborative,
                supportive, and diverse team. Our team ranged from Computer
                Science to just regular Science students, and we all had
                different backgrounds and experiences. Nonetheless, I bonded
                really well with the team and made great friends with a lot
                of them. Whether it was helping someone with a more complex
                ticket or getting guidance, I always felt like we were a
                team and in it together.
              </p>
              <p>
                I usually tried to make a point of offering help when things
                were busy and sharing whatever I had learned, whenever I
                could. In return, I learned a lot from my teammates and my
                supervisors, both technically and in behavior in terms of
                handling different interactions with clients. I’m happy to
                call my coworkers my friends and they turned this role into
                a very positive experience.

          <!-- Fall 2025 Introduction -->
          <h2><u><b>Fall 2025 Term (September - December)</b></u></h2>
          <p>This was my second Co-op work term during my undergraduate degree, and my second of two work terms with
            CCS.
            This term was the first experience I had in a full operating semester with all of Guelph’s students back
            on campus, both new and returning.
            This was also the first term where I got to meet the rest of the Help Centre team who were helping out
            part time at the Help Desk,
            so I was excited to see where this one was headed!
          </p>

              <!-- Strengthening Real-Time Communication -->
              <h5>Strengthening Real-Time Communication</h5>
              <p>
                This semester, with students fully back on campus, support demand increased significantly, especially
                at the start of
                term when many new students were getting familiar with university systems. I made it a goal to
                strengthen my real-time
                communication skills by taking on more phone and in-person tickets. These interactions often required
                me to explain
                technical steps verbally without visual aids, particularly when users struggled to follow digital
                instructions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this experience, I became more confident adjusting my tone, pacing, and explanations based on
                the client’s level
                of technical comfort. I learned to check for understanding more frequently and simplify my language
                when needed. As a
                result, issues were more often resolved in a single interaction, and I felt more confident
                communicating clearly under
                pressure.

              <h5>Deepening My Understanding of IT Systems</h5>
              <p>
                Rather than focusing only on resolving tickets, I wanted to better understand how the university’s IT
                systems work
                together. I made a habit of asking why issues occurred and tracing them back to their root causes,
                especially during
                high-volume periods early in the semester. This helped me build a clearer understanding of how systems
                like login
                services, Office 365, Gryph Mail, and OneDrive are interconnected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, this deeper understanding improved both my troubleshooting speed and accuracy. I became
                more confident
                explaining system behaviour to clients and teammates, which helped reduce confusion and improve
                support outcomes. This
                approach strengthened my technical literacy and problem-solving skills throughout the term.

              <h5>Integrating Technical Knowledge with User Perspective</h5>
              <p>
                A key goal for me this term was improving how I combined technical information with user perspective
                in both client
                interactions and documentation. I regularly reflected on what explanations were most effective and
                where users tended to
                get confused. This helped guide how I structured my responses and support materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also took the lead on updating several documentation websites assigned by my supervisor, ensuring
                the content was technically accurate while remaining easy to follow. By blending internal resources
                with personal troubleshooting experience, I was able to create clearer documentation and client
                responses that resulted in fewer follow-up questions.

              <h5>Developing Awareness of Digital Equity and Accessibility</h5>
              <p>
                This term highlighted how differently students and staff experience technology based on their resources
                and familiarity
                with university systems. Many clients relied on older devices, had limited internet access, or were new
                to using
                institutional tools, especially at the beginning of the semester. These interactions encouraged me to
                reflect more
                carefully on accessibility and digital equity.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, I adapted my support approach by offering alternative solutions, simplifying explanations,
                and being more
                patient with troubleshooting steps. These changes helped me provide more inclusive support and better
                meet the needs of
                under-resourced or accessibility-challenged users.

              <h5>Growing as a Team Contributor and Leader</h5>
              <p>
                Throughout the term, I focused on becoming a stronger team contributor and developing leadership skills.
                After
                discovering a way to track ticket volume, I was motivated to take initiative and handle a higher number
                of tickets. I
                also helped train new co-op students by walking them through systems, workflows, and common
                troubleshooting scenarios.In
                addition to my technical and leadership contributions, participating in team events such as our holiday
                gathering helped
                strengthen relationships across the team and reinforced a collaborative, supportive work environment.
                This was a great
                way to finish our term and the atmosphere was great!
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, I worked closely with part-time staff at the desk and built strong working relationships
                that turned into
                friendships. I also took the lead on several supervisor-assigned projects, including updating
                documentation and internal
                websites. These experiences helped me grow as a dependable, proactive team member and strengthened my
                confidence in
                taking on leadership responsibilities.

          <!-- Conclusions and Acknowledgements -->

          <h3>Conclusions</h3>
          <p>
            Looking back across both of my work terms, what stands out most is how much I’ve grown not just technically,
            but
            personally and professionally. When I first started, I was focused on learning the basics and becoming
            comfortable in
            the role. Over time, I’ve developed the confidence to take on more complex issues, explain systems more
            clearly, and
            work more independently. Seeing that progression across both terms has been incredibly rewarding and has
            shown me how
            much consistent learning and experience can add up.
          </p>
          <p>
            These roles strengthened my technical skills, but they also reinforced that IT support is fundamentally
            people-focused.
            I’ve learned to be more patient, empathetic, and adaptable in my interactions, especially when supporting
            users with
            different levels of technical experience or access to resources. Working closely with my teammates, training
            new co-op
            students, and building strong relationships with both full-time and part-time staff helped me grow as a
            communicator and
            a team member.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, these work terms confirmed my interest in IT and gave me a strong foundation to build on moving
            forward. I feel
            more confident in my abilities, more comfortable taking initiative, and better prepared to handle both
            technical
            challenges and human-centered problem solving. I’m proud of the growth I’ve achieved and grateful for the
            experiences
            and relationships that made it possible.
          </p>
          <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
          <p>
            I want to thank my incredible supervisor Jill Hogg for being so
            patient, understanding, and informative about everything in
            these first 8 months. Jill has taught me so much, and watching
            her work has been amazing to see. She has the patience and work
            ethic of an absolute warrior and is incredibly resourceful and
            shows that she cares about us.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to also thank my fellow students that I worked with for
            making work fun to come to and for being awesome teammates
            throughout the entire term. We had some tough moments in
            relation to our job, but I’m incredibly happy that we were able
            to bond and that only helped us get through our tougher moments.
            I’m very proud to call you all my friends and not just my
            coworkers now.
